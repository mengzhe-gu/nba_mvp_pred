# nba_mvp_pred
This is a project to predict 2023 NBA MVP

## Why did I start this project?
After graduating from Master of Data Science at USYD, I always want to start a project that is related to my personal interest. So I started this idea to keep practicing my skills while I enjoy the process. 

## How to access the dataset?
The dataset can be accessed through the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertsunderhaft/nba-player-season-statistics-with-mvp-win-share. However, please note that I have done quite a few cleaning, so the data that is used in the analysis is not the same as raw dataset.

## Can we coleberate?
Yes, if you have great ideas or advice about this project, or if you want to work with me on this project, please contact me through my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mengzhe-gu-148b46277/.
